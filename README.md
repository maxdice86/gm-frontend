#                                                     Revenue Database Project !!!

This project is a complete full stack demo. It was built using React native for front end and Spring Boot java for backend.

Database used is H2 embebbed memory and will reload data a new upon reboot of server. Make sure you have java installed to run exe file or .jar versions of backend
